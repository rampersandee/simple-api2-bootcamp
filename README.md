# ðŸ“Š Project: Simple API 2

### Goal: Display data returned from an api

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>Simple API.</li>
  <li>The HTML and CSS-simplistic. Inputs and a button; nothing fancy.</li>
  <li>The JavaScript was also simple as it goes.</li>  
  <li>I simply take the first letter of the user's name and populate a 5-items list.  That's it.  Really.  I mean there's a Math.Random() in there to populate the list, but that's about as complicated as it gets.</li>
  <li>The hardest part as probably finding a League of Legends API that didn't expire after a day and a half.</li>

<p>Overall, I am not proud of the API because it's so simple.  I got it done just because I had to; I did not have much affinity for it.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>It's done. I just wish I had an API that allowed for pictures, but I could have solved that with an image search API.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 4 <em>Once again, it's done.  Pretty simple in it's execution.</em></li>
</ul>
